Nyapal's SUP 2.2 Porject. 

Originally I was going to build of a project that previously existed but I couldn't find it :/ so I rebuild the frontend of the project which was the simple part. The frontend is built using react. Next I added a backend in Django. It was an interested experience. Django like React has (in my opinion) a steep learning curve but once you get a hang of how it works it's pretty simple to get up and running. This is a simple CRUD app which has a directory of a bunch of different types of house plants. Features to be added, a blog and a shop. 

To Set Up: 
  Clone & Install Node Modules 
  - get the backend up & runnning 'python3 manage.py runserver'
  - get the frontend up & running 'npm start' 
  - go to localhost:3000
